Data sets for the Philippine covid-19
Good day. I'm a non-practicing physician that is trying to get to learn more about data science.
Since my knowledge and experience in data science is still at the beginner level at best,
yet still wanting to try and help, I resolved to try my best to collate data regarding the covid-19.

The NCR hospital file is an excel sheet of the Philhealth accredited hospitals in the national capital region
as of October 2019.

I would upload other data or note here websites to gather informattion regarding covid-19.
